It is an interdisciplinary field that includes biology, geography, and Earth science. Ecology includes the study of interactions that organisms have with each other, other organisms, and with abiotic components of their environment. Topics of interest to ecologists include the diversity, distribution, amount (biomass), and number (population) of particular organisms, as well as cooperation and competition between organisms, both within and among ecosystems. Ecosystems are composed of dynamically interacting parts including organisms, the communities they make up, and the non-living components of their environment. Ecosystem processes, such as primary production, pedogenesis, nutrient cycling, and various niche construction activities, regulate the flux of energy and matter through an environment. These processes are sustained by organisms with specific life history traits, and the variety of organisms is called biodiversity. Biodiversity, which refers to the varieties of species, genes, and ecosystems, enhances certain ecosystem services."

The church is a domed cube with a stucco exterior.[3] The church, originally called the ""First Independent Church of Baltimore"", is the oldest building continuously used by a Unitarian congregation. The name was changed in 1935 to ""The First Unitarian Church of Baltimore (Unitarian and Univeralist)"" following the merger with the former Second Universalist Church at East Lanvale Street and Guilford Avenue in East Baltimore. The Unitarians (founded 1825) and Universalists merged as a national denomination in 1961."
